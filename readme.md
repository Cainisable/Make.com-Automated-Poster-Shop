This is a larger project that is capable of running a poster shop without any human intervention, from the inception of the design, to the listing in the online store, posting on Social media, and even creating and shipping the product to the customer. 

Additionally, it has some cool functionalities including:

1. Perfoming QA on the generated artwork to avoid low-quality pieces being posted (this isn't perfect but can filter out the most egregious examples).
2. Generating different images based on the day of the week, with completely random prompts to ensure you never get the same image twice.
3. Generating Mockups

It's alot to screenshot so instead I'm going to focus on the most important sections:
